# AI Governance Framework  

## 1️⃣ Purpose  
The AI Executive Director in SkySeaSpaceNet is designed to **assist** with decision-making, **not autonomously control**. Its function is to enhance **real-time tracking, anomaly detection, and scientific research** while following a **transparent, ethical framework**.  

## 2️⃣ Linear Decision-Making Model  
The AI follows a **step-by-step structured process** for evaluating aerospace, space, and underwater tracking data:  
1. **Data Collection & Filtering** → Ingests ADS-B, radar, sonar, satellite signals.  
2. **Anomaly Detection & Categorization** → Identifies aircraft, UAPs, USOs, space objects.  
3. **Risk Evaluation & Policy Alignment** → Flags high-risk objects, aligns with FAA, ICAO, Space Force, NATO, etc.  
4. **Human Review & Validation** → Any flagged anomalies undergo **human verification** before reports are finalized.  
5. **Public & Government Reporting** → Generates **scientific, open-access, and policy reports**.  

## 3️⃣ Ethical Safeguards  
- AI decisions **cannot override human intervention**.  
- AI-generated data must be **auditable and explainable**.  
- AI operates with **full transparency**—all logs and decision-making processes are stored on **Arweave/IPFS** for open access.
